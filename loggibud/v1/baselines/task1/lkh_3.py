    The output is stored in a TSPLIB-like format. Here is a typical example.

    Suppose a problem with depot at node 1 and deliveries at 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6.
    Now, suppose the solution has two routes such as:
        - Route 1: [1, 2, 3]
        - Route 2: [1, 4, 5, 6]

    first route. Then, we reach a node 7, which is greater than all nodes in
    the problem. This actually marks the start of another route, and if we had
    more routes, it would be split with an 8, and so on.

    The reading goes on until a -1 is obtained, thus marking the end of all
    routes.

    The typical number of vehicles used internally by the LKH-3 is given by

    Unfortunately, this does not work in some cases. Here is a simple example.
    Consider three deliveries with demands 3, 4 and 5, and assume the vehicle
    capacity is 6. The total demand is 12, so according to this equation we
    would require ceil(12 / 6) = 2 vehicles.
    Unfortunately, there is no way to place all three deliveries in these two
    vehicles without splitting a package.

    Thus, we use a workaround by assuming all packages have the same maximum
    demand. Thus, we can place `floor(vehicle_capacity / max_demand)` packages
    in a vehicle. Dividing the total number of packages by this we get an
    estimation of how many vehicles we require.

    This heuristic is an overestimation and may be too much in some cases,
    but we found that the solver is more robust in excess (it ignores some
    vehicles if required) than in scarcity (it returns an unfeasible solution).
